alias loops would be recognized with a '!' at the start of their names

> aliasloop echo4EvrLmao "echo ez banana"
> echo4EvrLmao
> ez banana
> ez banana
> ez banana
> ez banana
> ...
> echo4EvrLmao
> # stopped spamming "ez banana"

create toggle aliases (they use +/-)

ex:

# in the console it is basically useless, but in-game is useful
> alias +a "echo on"; alias -a "echo off"
> +a
> on
>
> -a
> off

# in-game example:
> alias +a "echo on"; alias -a "echo off"
> bind w +a
> w pressed
> on
> w released
> off
> # it works like an event

so:
alias banana # normal alias
alias +banana # alias toggle - can only be checked with a game system or event handling or something
alias !banana # loop alias
!!! for now there is only normal alias implemented !!!

console might be better off in a separate thread of the game
